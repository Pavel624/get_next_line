There was a time, I used to look into my father's eyes
In a happy home, I was a king I had a golden throne
Those days are gone, the memories are on the wall

I hear the sounds from the places where I was born
Up on the hill across the blue lake
That's where I had my first heart break 
I still remember how it all changed 
My father said
Don't you worry, don't you worry child
See heaven's got a plan for you
Don't you worry, don't you worry now, yeah
